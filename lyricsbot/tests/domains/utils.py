EXPECTED_EMPTYSELF_FOR_GENIUS = """I don't like artificial light,
but I use it every night.
No other way to see.
No the day won't stay for me.

And when the lights go out,
memory gets me around
as I wander through the dark,
but I can't get very far.
And once again I find,
I'm no good at being blind,
and the light of every day
can never be replaced.

Don't mistake the true for the fake.
A raft for an island,
asleep for awake.
There are so many ways to evade
what's right in front of your face.

If there's a way,
I'd rather not remain
so lost in disarray.
My brain a battlefield
of the wounded and the healed.
And as my reach is short,
these hands could use support
to climb out of the trench
I keep on falling in.

Don't mistake the true for the fake.
A raft for an island, asleep for awake.
There are so many ways to evade
what's right in front of your face.

Drank you in
but I still thirst.
Not the answer
I thought you were.
All we said.
What's it worth?
Not an anchor, only words."""

EXPECTED_FLORENCE = """The looking glass, so shiny and new
How quickly the glamor fades
I start spinning slipping out of time
Was that the wrong pill to take?

Raise it up
You made a deal and now
It seems you have to offer up
But will it ever be enough?

Raise it up
Raise it up
It's not enough
Raise it up
Raise it up

Here I am, a rabbit hearted girl
Frozen in the headlights
It seems I made the final sacrifice

We raise it up
This offering
We raise it up

This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

I look around but I can't find you
Raise it up
If only I could see your face
Raise it up

I started rushing towards the starlight
Raise it up
I wish that I could just be brave

I must become the lion hearted girl
Ready for a fight
Before I make the final sacrifice

We raise it up
This offering
We raise it up

This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

Raise it up
Raise it up
Raise it up
Raise it up

And in the spring I shed my skin
And it blows away with the changing wind
The water has turned from blue to red
As towards the sky I offer it

This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
And Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
And Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
And Midas is king and he holds me so tight
